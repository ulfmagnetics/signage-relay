Colder air will also move in during the afternoon, with enough mixing to keep fine particulate concentrations in the good range for the daily average. A bit of snow Saturday night may even bring a dusting as temperatures fall into the upper 20s.  ***  Sunday's forecast: Breezy and chilly Sunday as temperatures struggle to reach the 40 degree mark. A couple of snow showers are possible late in the day and at night as a weak area of low pressure passes to the north. Strong vertical and horizontal mixing will promote good air quality.  ***  Monday's forecast: Morning clouds will give way to partly sunny skies by Monday afternoon as it continues breezy with good dispersion keeping fine particulate low.  ***  Extended forecast: Low pressure will bring a mix of snow and rain Tuesday, and with the precipitation present, PM2.5 levels should remain in the good range. Brisk and cold Wednesday with a few snow showers in the wake of this system along with low levels of particles. The cold will not last, though, as temperatures warm again late in the week.---McAuliffe"
